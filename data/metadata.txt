## DESCRIPTION OF COLUMNS AND VALUES IN data_morphology.csv
##
## This dataframe contains all morphological information needed
## for the analyses. Specimen information and morphological measures
## were collected by Alan G. Braz and a more detailed desciption on
## methods are available in the published article (http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/jbi.14687)
##
## Observations:
##    (1) some unnecessary columns for this project were removed
##        from the original dataframe;
##    (2) only specimens with linear measures taken from the skull
##        are registered;
##    (3) empty cells must be considered as NA values. Empty cells were
##        used in cases of missing information or measures that could not
##        be taken. Scripts in this project are already prepared to work
##        with this empty cells;
##    (4) column names and values are in Brazilian portuguese
